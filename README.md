- The dist folder is the build React app
- The app.py file is where to put the result of the data
- Feel free to create new python file
- After installing the dependencies or packages run the app.py file and open http://127.0.0.1:3000 to see the interface
- If installing the packages doesn't work. Try to manually install. I only install two packages.
  pip install flask and pip install flask-cors
- The python version needs to be between 3.9 and 3.12

```bash
pip install flask
pip install flask-cors
pip install FlagEmbedding
```
